						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that accessibility is essential in digital product design since it's the practice of crafting experiences for all people,
								including those of us with visual, speech, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities. 
								And it was interesting to know that we can ensure accessibility by making sure we don't rely on color to relay crucial system information.
								I also learned that the most important aspect of creating an accessible color system is giving our team the ability to reference it when needed, so everyone is clear about proper usage.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the part where the author mentioned 'adding enough contrast.'
								I like that it tells us the background-to-text constrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 to meet W3C's minimum AA rating.
								And I think tools like Colorable and Colorsafe could be extremely helpful for testing the accessibility of color combinations when creating my own website.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Color accessibility enables people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies to interact with digital experiences in the same way as their non-visually-impaired counterparts." </p>
						</li>
