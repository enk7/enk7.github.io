					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From the article, I learned that when elements change their state or position, 
								the duration of the animation should be slow enough to give users the possibility to notice the change,
								but at the same time quick enough not to cause waiting. 
								I also learned that according to researchers, optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms.
								And it is interesting to know that material design guidelines also suggests limiting the duration of animation to 200-300 ms.
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the part where the author inserted gifs showing when the bouncing effect
								could be distracted. I thought bouncing effects can always put emphasis on the content, but from the given gif, 
								it can cut off the flow. I also liked the part where the author highlighted equal interaction.
								Specifically, it was interesting to know that the contents should be in one fluid direction to catch user's attention. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
