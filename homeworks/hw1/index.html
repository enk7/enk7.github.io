            <li>From the article, I learned that thinking as if we were the designers of a product 
                helps us develop our design eyes. I also realized breaking down each feature from the app lets us 
                observe each component in detail.

                My favorite part of this article is definitely the part where the author showed deconstructed gifs for Airbnb, Twitter, and Spotify apps as well as oberservations.
                This is because these step-by-step visual references are more conspicuous to emphasize which features to highlight in apps and websites.

                Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."
