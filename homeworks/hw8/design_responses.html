					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that Dark Patterns are deceptive UX/UI interactions and designed to mislead or trick users to make them do something they don't want to do.
							I also learned good user experience design is about providing the users with seamless, enjoyable interactions with products and is not deceptive or sneaky in nature. 
							Most importantly, dark patterns have been around for as long as we can remember and they aren't limited to the web. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article is the explanation of types of Dark Patterns as it breaks down the ambiguous term 'Dark Patterns' by giving examples and diving deep into each type.
							Specifically, it was interesting that Brignull named 'Privacy Zuckering' dark pattern after Facebook's CEO becaused it was first identified on Facebook.
							I also liked that the author emphasized the seriousness of Dark Patterns by saying that they have been improved with time and are now designed to trick the more aware user as well. </p>
