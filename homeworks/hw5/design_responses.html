                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From the article, I learned that choosing purple for the background of Travel Map 
                                helps us focus on the map itself easier. Especially for complex visualizations like maps or pages filled up with long texts,
                                it is essential to use contrast colors in the background.
                                And from easygrow.io app preview, I learned that although background colors don't really match between pages, by organizing the background color with the keyword for each page,
                                it's much more visually pleasing. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was watching all these different creative UI interactions.
                                I usually don't come across these visually appealing websites, so I liked all the gifs as it broadened my creative views.
                                And I liked how I could see well-combined colors.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration from this article is definitely 'Shopping App Transitions by Vlad Fedoseyev for Norde.'
                                This is because in my opinion, it has both simplicity and uniqueness.
                                I've seen a lot of shopping websites/apps that is just too overwhelming to read the description due to their unpleasant color choices and unorganized/packed contents.
                                But for this one, I could see that they only highlighted the name of the product with light brown color and set all the other texts in gray, with gradiation. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p> 9/10. I enjoyed reading this article since it gave me insights in how to be creative and visually pleasing at the same time. </p>
