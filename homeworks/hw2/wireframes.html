					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, 
								create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. 
								(use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wf1.jpg">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, 
								and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using 
								the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/wf2.jpg"> </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? 
								How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. 
								(Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of this website is to provide information that a user wants. 
								It is intended for people of all age who are either trying to search something online 
								or just seeking for any news updates around the world. 
								The design lets the users find the searchbox at ease to search keywords immediately without distractions. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, 
								and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I encountered a problem from Google's website that it lets the bottom part of the page blank instead of utilizing efficiently.
								It also has an unnecessary 'Google Search' button that can easily be replaced by pressing Return/Enter. 
								So I removed both 'Google Search' and 'I'm Feeling Lucky' buttons and added 'Daily search trends' and 'Realtime search trends'
								to see the world news at a glance and to get rid of negative space. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website 
							and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
