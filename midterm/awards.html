                At SoDoI, we live by the three values of 1) Never Give Up, 2) Always Be Truthful, and 3) Love Life. We also want to recognize individuals who we have seen live life in those ways.
                As a result, we want to present our SoDoI of the Month Award! Since we started in February, a specific individual has always stood out to us in the way she served her family, friends, and the community of Berkeley. 
                She has such a huge heart for the communities that she is part of in Berkeley, whether in dance, school, or work. Weâ€™ve seen her generosity, kindness, and ability to listen displayed on numerous occasions to friends, strangers, and the homeless. 
                Our February SoDoI of the Month Award goes to our very own Andria Gao!

                At SoDoI, we search for individuals who really have the heart of SoDoI. Individuals that not only know our core values, but live them out in their lives and everything that they do. From the moment Hannah first came to SoDoI, 
                the one thing that was apparent was her love for people and serving others. Her love overflowed from her and was present in everything she did. We are so honored to have her as part of our family! From taking care of and feeding the sick 
                to constantly serving her community, she is an amazing blessing because of the love in her. Everything she does, she does with her whole heart and with a smile on her face. We are more than happy to recognize Hannah as a true SoDoI!
